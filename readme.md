Here I collect tools for simulations for Theseus. 

This includes exposure maps created by myself based on obssim run results (i.e. ra, dec as function of time. These are the fits files in the root directory), and "official" exposure maps (exposure_maps.tar.gz) directly converted from output of the obssim run v2.1. If you just need exposure map, it is better to use the later version (exposure_maps.tar.gz)  as it uses actual field of view and effective areas of *Theseus* instruments and was calculated by ESA as part of obssim runs. The unit of these maps is total exposure in days achieved in 4 years of nominal mission lifetime. The maps are provided in equatorial and Galactic projections and include GRB pointings. The other maps are left here only as a reference.

The repository also contans an example of obssim output I used to create old version of the maps. This is useful if you want, for instance, get an idea on coverage of a given sky location by *Theseus* over its lifetime. An example of how you could do that is contained in the example.ipynb notebook. Obviously, you could modify the code as you like (for instance, to include multiple obssim runs available from Theseus website). If you do that and come up with something you think could be useful for larger group of people, please let me know and consider hosting it here.

There is also an interactive (via binder) version of this notebook mentioned above which you can use to get some info for a particular source without installing or downloading anything. To do that, click on the binder link below, wait a bit (or a long time) and change source name and instrument in In[2] field.
After that re-run the entire notebook to update plots numbers
